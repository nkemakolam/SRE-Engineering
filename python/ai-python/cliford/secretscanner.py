# Example usage:
text = "Here is my password: mySecret123, and my API key: 2a1b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c."
credentials = find_secret_credentials(text)
print(credentials)
In this example, the find_secret_credentials function accepts an input string and searches for potential secret credentials based on the provided regex patterns. You can customize the patterns list to include any additional regex patterns you want to search for. The function returns a list of matching secret credentials found in the input string.

Please note that this is a basic example, and the actual patterns and logic may vary depending on your specific use case and the types of secret credentials you want to identify. Additionally, be cautious when handling potentially sensitive information, and ensure you have the necessary permissions and legal requirements in place when working with such data.
